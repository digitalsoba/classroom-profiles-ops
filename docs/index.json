	"content": " How to use and deploy Drone CICD Drone is an open source CI/CD tools that uses docker container for pipelines. It\u0026rsquo;s fast and highly configurable\nDrone requirements: - Docker - Docker-compose - Github OAuth access\nCreate an OAuth App On Github, navigate to your Settings --\u0026gt; Developer Settings --\u0026gt; OAuth Apps. Create a new OAuth app. For both URLs we are using HTTPS because we will generate a Cert with Letâ€™s Encrypt when drone is deployed.\nInputs - Application name: Anything you want - Homepage URL: https://drone.example.com - Application description - Optional - Authorization callback URL - https://drone.example.com/login\nAfter you created your app you should be welcomed with a page that contains Client ID and Client Secret, make sure you save this.\nCreating the docker-compose.yml file Drone runs purely in containers, in our example we\u0026rsquo;re going use a single machine. We can further expand drone to use additional agents to increase task capacity. We will need two files created: docker-compose.yml and a .env file.\ndocker-compose.yml version: '3' services: drone: container_name: drone image: 'drone/drone:1.0.0-rc.1' restart: always ports: - '80:80' - '443:443' volumes: - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock' - '/var/lib/drone:/data' environment: - DRONE_GITHUB_SERVER=https://github.com - DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID - DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=$CLIENT_SECRET - DRONE_RUNNER_CAPACITY=2 - DRONE_SERVER_HOST=$SERVER_HOST - DRONE_SERVER_PROTO=https - DRONE_TLS_AUTOCERT=true - DRONE_USER_FILTER=$ORG, $USER - DRONE_USER_CREATE=username:$USER,machine:false,admin:true  .env # Grab these from the OAuth app $CLIENT_ID=pastefromgithub $CLIENT_SECRET=pastefromgithub # This will be host where drone is installed $SERVER_HOST=drone.example.com # This can be a github user or a machine user $USER=user $ORG=githuborganization  Transfering yaml file There are multiple ways to deploy drone, one method is using the ansible playbook. This playbook will also install docker and docker compose. Another option is to rsync or create the docker-compose.yml file and .env file. After, run docker-compose up -d.\nUsing the ansible playbook Make sure you have ansible installed on your master machine and python/python3. Create an .env file in the docker/drone directory with the required environment variables. Switch to the ansible/playbooks/drone directory. Create a hosts.ini file and specify your host and username; also use python3 as a python interpreter. An example below\n[drone] drone.example.com [drone:vars] ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_user=user  Run ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass drone.yml to deploy.\n"

	"content": " Intro The Elastic stack or ELK (Old nickname) is an open source set of tools that allow us to gather logs and metrics and visualize them. The main components of the include: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elastic Search is used to search, analyze, and store data. Logstash aggregates data into Elasticsearch. Kibana let\u0026rsquo;s use visualize our data. The stack also includes beats which are lightweight data shippers that point to either Elasticsearch or Logstash. For our stack, we also added Nginx as a reverse proxy for Kibana. The basic flow of information looks like this (Source: Digitalocean): Prerequisites  Ansible SSH access to the servers you\u0026rsquo;re running tha playbook against  Python2/3   Install ELK stack master playbook Clone the ops repo if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already and change directory into the project.\ngit clone \u0026lt;insert project\u0026gt;\ncd ansible/playbooks/elk\nWe need to add hosts to run the playbook against. Create a host.ini file with your favorite text editor ex.\nvim hosts.ini.\nIn the host inventory you will need: elk, beats, beats-python2:\n# Master ELK server [elk] example.com # Node servers [beats] example.com 2.example.com # Nodes using python2 [beats-python2] ssh.matabit.org # Variables for hosts [beats:vars] ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_user=user [beats-python2:vars] ansible_ssh_user=user [elk:vars] ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_user=user  The master playbook is elk.yml. This playbook will install the Elastic stack and load the Filebeat dashboards into the server. To run the playbook:\nansible-playbook elk.yml\nAfter installing the master node verify the services are up by visiting the elk server on your web browser. If the stack is not up check the server to see if the ELK services are up and visit the logs. If everything is running you can move on to configuring Kibana and installing beats on your server nodes.\nConfiguring Kibana In Kibana set the default index pattern to Filebeat-*. Visit the Kibana page, navigate to Management--\u0026gt;Kibana--\u0026gt;Index Patterns. Select Filebeat-* on the left hand side, the page will load the index patterns; select the star on the right hand side to set Filebeat-* as the default index.\nInstall beats into nodes Filebeat ships log data into the master elk server. This playbook is located in ansible/playbooks/elk under the filename elk-beats.yml. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already add hosts to into your inventory under beats and beats-python2.\nWhen ready to deploy run\nansible-playbook elk-beats\nAfter the playbook completes, verify beats are being shipped by visiting Kibana\u0026rsquo;s discovery tab.\nAnsible playbook explanation Playbooks and roles The playbooks are found in the ops repo for the project in the ansible/playbook/elk directory. This contains ansible.cfg, elk.yml, elk-beats.yml and hosts.ini.\n ansible.cfg - Contains the path for roles and hosts inventory elk.yml - This is the main playbook that use the elk and elk load roles elk-beats.yml - Installs Filebeat and enables modules hosts.ini - Inventory of hosts to run the playbook against  Roles ELK playbook: Installs ELK stack with Nginx Proxy\n elk - Installs Java, adds Elastic repo, installs ELK services and Nginx proxy  vars - Contains variable for ELK host, edit this templates - Contains Logstash pipelines configs.  elk-load - Installs Filebeat and loads index patterns and sample dashboards  ELK-beats playbook: this playbook will install Filebeat into the node servers with the systems, apache, and Nginx modules enabled.\n elk-beats - Installs Filebeat service for debian and redhat based distros. Starts and enables the service.  vars - Contains variable for ELK host, edit this   Things to consider  Add SSL cert on Nginx Proxy   Issues "
